This is a fun and interactive game where you need to **catch** a randomly moving box. The box changes its position every second, and the goal is to click on it before it moves again! Upon clicking, the game ends with a "Game Over!" message.

## Description

In this game, the `#myBox` element moves around the screen at random positions at a regular interval. 

- **Hover over the box**: It will display the message "Please Don't ðŸ˜®" with a yellow background.
- **Mouse leaves**: The box resets to the initial text and background.
- **Clicking the box**: The game ends, displaying "Game Over!" with a green box, and it stops moving.
  
The game uses basic DOM manipulation and JavaScript event listeners to handle movement and user interactions. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice CSS animations and JavaScript events.
